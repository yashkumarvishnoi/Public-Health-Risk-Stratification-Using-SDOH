
Current Progress:- 
1. Initial Synthetic Dataset Created, considering few necessary clinical dataset attributes for individuals and following that same with SDOH dataset created with general disease keeping in mind.
2. Worked with lightbgm model with balancing the weights due to imbalance dataset being created.
3. Managed to join the datasets with dtcode11 col and added the feature of District names as well in SDOH dataset.
4. Successfully donloaded and am using a geojson file for the districts of Uttarakhand as the core to visualize the prediction of diseases spred district wise.
5. Initial model training and test have provided decent evaluation score following with intial visualization of the district disease risk map being generated.


Tasks to Perfom:
1. Add feature of seasonality for specific based diseas like malaria and dengue.
2. Adding specific disease for each prediction providing base to tackle all disease outbreak in State.
3. Improve the model accuracy and work on it to deliver better results.
4. Search for a better real dataset with the necessary attributes to deliver the results in real life.
5. Achieve the core visualization and pointing of factors to ech of disease for cause and prevention.
